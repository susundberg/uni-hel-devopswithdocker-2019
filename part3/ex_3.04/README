The dockerfiles at ../ex_3.03/Dockerfile_front and ../ex_3.04/Dockerfile_back are modified for using the node10-alpine version.

Frontend:
 - Image with ubuntu:16.04 with best optimization: 455MB
 - With node:10-alpine: 263MB

Backend:
 - Image with ubuntu:16.04 with best optimization: 332MB
 - With node:10-alpine:139MB

And the dockerfiles are much cleaner without the node-10 installation hassle.
