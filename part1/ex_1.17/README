The docker image is published at: https://hub.docker.com/r/supauli/uni-hel-devopswithdocker-2019-part1-1-17


My favorite programming enviroment is python3. I usually prefer installing packages from the package manager over the pip - since in that case someone is taking care of possible native dependencies and even possibly security updates.
 
I have used the base image of ubuntu-18.04 that is currently the latest stable -- and i prefer stables for the app development unless there is very specific reason why not. 

The dockers image could be used in development by mounting local source directory inside the container, and the container could run in "entr" mode (run whenever file is edited) flake8 + unittests.
